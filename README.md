#CS50X Web Programming Final Project
This is my CS50x Web Programming Course Final Project!

In this project I:

- Designed a fake shop website using a Django Framework for the final project for the CS50x Web Programming course offered by Harvard University

- Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end aspects of the website.

- Used Python to store the website's data in a SQLite Database

- Functionality of the website included the user having an account, user being able to add to cart, create and save orders, create and save reviews, and contact the "superuser" of the website.
